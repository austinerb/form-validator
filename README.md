Simple form validation using vanilla js. You can't submit the form until all fields are valid.

Trouble with already completed fields. The fields won't check as valid until they are edited, so prefilled fields won't check as valid until they are edited again. 

DRY principles were poorly followed as I repeated several functions with slightly different implementations. Also, my focus on design was getting in my way of writing code... CSS can be so finicky.
